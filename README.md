The error message you provided indicates that there's a problem with the line using namespace std;. However, this line is valid C++ code and should not result in a syntax error if you're writing C++.
Python Interpreter: If you're seeing this error message in Python, it's because using namespace std; is C++ syntax, not Python. Python and C++ are distinct programming languages
Incorrect Language Selection: Make sure you're running your C++ code in a C++ compiler, such as g++, and not trying to run it as a Python program. C++ code should have a .cpp file extension, and you compile and run it using a C++ compiler.
